===============================================

Why use django-group-access?
----------------------------

You'd want to use django-group-access if you're looking for:

  * Basic row-level security (has/doesn't have access)
  * Easy configuration (And we mean EASY)
  * Minimal changes to your existing code
  * Security that can be applied to third party code without having to maintain a branch of that code
  * Automatic application of security filters
